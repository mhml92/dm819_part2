\section{Introduction}
  This report details the implementation of KD-Tree and Range-Tree for 
  $d$-dimensional input. Each tree is constructed from a list of unsorted points
  and is capable of performing orthogonal range queries.
  \subsection{Definitions}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item a $d$-dimensional point, $p$, consists of real numbers $(p_1,p_2,\dots,p_d)$
  	\item a $d$-dimensional range, $R$, is a hyper-volume defined by $[r_1:r_1']
  	\times[r_2:r_2']\times \dots \times [r_d:r_d']$, where each $r$ is a real number
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Range Queries}
  Given a set of points, $P$, and a range object, $R$, a range query consist of
  reporting all points in $P$ which intersect $R$ e.g. a 1-dimensional point
  set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and a range object $[2:4]$ yields $\{2,3,4\}$. 
  
  
  
  %that intersects 
  %a 
  %A point $p \in P$ exists in the range $R$ iff.
  %\[
  %  \forall p_i \in p: \{ R_{i,1}\leq   p_i \leq R_{i,2}\}|\forall i \in \{1,...,n\}, n = dimensions 
  %\]
  %
  %A range query consists of reporting all points, $p$, which lie within a given 
  %range, $R$.
  %An $n$-dimensional point, $P_n$, consist of real numbers 
  %$\{p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n\}$, and an $n$-dimensional range $R_n$ consist of 
  %$[x:x']\times[y:y'] \times \dots \times[z:z']$. A range query consist of 
  %reporting all points $P_n$ in a range $R_n$.
\section{KD-Tree}
\subsection{Complexity}
\section{Range-Tree}
  A Range-tree is a multi-level data structure for time efficient range queries.
  In 2-dimensional the firs-level of the range tree is a binary search tree on 
  the $x$-coordinate. Each node has an associated data structure for all
  points in its canonical set. The associated data structure is a binary 
  search tree on the $y$-coordinate of the points. 
  To report which points are in a given range is a 1-dimensional range search 
  performed for each dimension, that is, first find all leaf nodes which lie 
  within $[x:x']$ in the first level, then determine which of those nodes 
  $y$-coordinate lie within $[y:y']$ on the second level. 
 \section{Test}
    \subsection{Test Generation}
    Supplied with the code is a test generating script which can create tests of
    arbitrary dimension and size. The tests are stored in directories by 
    dimension.
    
    In a tests consisting of $n$ points in $d$ dimensions a $d$-dimensional 
    volume is constructed with a side length $s = \sqrt[d]{n}$. For each such 
    volume is $1000$ ranges generated with a side length of 
    $rs = \sqrt[d]{0.1 \cdot s^d}$ i.e. each range will contain approximately 
    10\% of the $n$ points.

  \subsection{File Formats}
  \subsubsection{Input}
  The input file format consist of two distinctest parts: \textit{points} and 
  \textit{ranges}. 
  \\
  \\
  Points are a real numbers for each dimension separated by \verb|<TAB>| and 
  each range element is two real number separated by \verb|:| and each dimension
  is separated by \verb|<TAB>|.
  \\
  \\
  The range part also has an optional \verb|<TAB>| separated list of integers 
  corresponding to the indexes of the points intersecting the range.  
  \begin{verbatim}
  	<real> \t <real>
  	<real>:<real> \t <real>:<real> [, <integer> \t <integer>]
  \end{verbatim}
  
  \begin{lstlisting}
  	3	3
  	2	2
  	1	1
  	4	4
  	5	5
	2:4	2:4,1	2	4
